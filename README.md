1st Suggestion:
"2. The next thing I would focus on would be your banner you put on your homepage. Although it is a really nice and relevant image the issue lies in the fact that it looks clear and not grainy in a mobile size but once you get closer to a large tablet or monitor screen size, it becomes pretty grainy. To fix this, you could potentially look for an image with a higher resolution. (Screenshot does not really show the issue)"

2nd Suggestion:
"3. The final thing I would look into would be the whitespace on the sides of the body of some of your pages. On larger monitors it can make the website feel a little empty, despite your good content. To remedy this you could implement a "max-width" container or adjust margins and padding."
