1st Suggestion:
"2. The next thing I would focus on would be your banner you put on your homepage. Although it is a really nice and relevant image the issue lies in the fact that it looks clear and not grainy in a mobile size but once you get closer to a large tablet or monitor screen size, it becomes pretty grainy. To fix this, you could potentially look for an image with a higher resolution. (Screenshot does not really show the issue)"

2nd Suggestion:
"3. The final thing I would look into would be the whitespace on the sides of the body of some of your pages. On larger monitors it can make the website feel a little empty, despite your good content. To remedy this you could implement a "max-width" container or adjust margins and padding."

I really appreciated and agreed with these suggestions. For the first suggestion about the banner image, I agree that the sizing and stretching of the image for different resolutions can change the image resolution. This can definitely be remedied with a high resolution image. I tried my best to find a hi-res image of Kitsap without resorting to similar landscapes but that were not set in Kitsap County. I was able to find a better resolution image, but not hi-res unfortunately. I tried to enhance the sharpness and quality of the image in Photoshop, but little took effect. The search for a hi res image still stands, but for now the new altered image is the replacement. 

This website was made using a typical laptop monitor, and unfortunately cannot simulate a large monitor's dimensions. Larger monitors will inevitably contain more whitespace than desired, and the solution of a "max-width" container may work, but breaks the website. It's also very common for websites across the internet to show a bit more whitespace than needed on these large wide monitors. But restructuring is required and improvement will be worked on.
